The team concluded their current progress with a successful Scrum Review that gave plenty of insight on how to improve this week's Sprint. This week's emphasis is on a much more active sprint backlog partcipation by each member of the team, as well as a more heavy focus on TDD.

The aims for today are:
1. Creating Java functions that call the SQL procedures that sort medical procedures based on highest cost and highest rating.
2. Creating coloured markers that represent different costs for procedures on the google map.
3. Updating the UI to reflect the changes covered in the Scrum Review (change names of the search button and shift searching to the homepage).
4. Creat Sprint Backlog for this week and begin process of updating it throughout week.
