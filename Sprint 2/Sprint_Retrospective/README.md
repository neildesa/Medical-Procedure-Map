Sprint Retrospective – Analysis

What did we decide to improve on after the last sprint?
The elements we had decided to improve upon included the daily updates to what we are progressing on. This was also accompanied by wanting to have more detailed evidence of commits on pull requests. Similarly, actions wanted to take that we felt we could be improved include the value of Trello and the other management-based tools we have been using over the course of Sprint 1. Most of the elements boil down to improving the tracking of time, as this was the only element, we felt we lacked as most of the time tracking was done towards the end, rather than during.

What have we done to improve on the points mentioned above?
The main elements that we have improved between sprints are active timekeeping and working on keeping a more consistent sprint backlog, this has included daily commits to the log, showing people actively updating it each time the person completing the tasks has a new development, or updates how long they have spent doing it. This is an improvement, as it keeps live, daily tracking for each individual and how they are progressing, giving each member of the team a much better idea of how each of the people are working and what they are working on at any given time. This meant everyone could check who was assigned to something, without needing to go and check on them in person, saving time and keeping it a lot more professional as not everyone was always in the same spot. 
Another process we wanted to improve on this sprint was Product Backlog, In this sprint, similarly to timekeeping, we managed to keep an up to date, daily updated system that meant there was a lot more upkeep on what was actually functioning/being done. This meant that everyone had a good idea of how on track we were as a team, meaning we could act as needed if something looked like it had fallen behind then someone else could assist with it. 
With scrums, we had discussed lightly before what we wanted to do with the scrums, deciding on keeping a roughly similar format, the main addition was that people would offer assistance at points when it was appropriate (aka what they’re doing today/problems) and this meant they were a lot more productive overall. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, overall we have taken the retrospective and applied it in the sprint. This meant the sprint overall has gone a lot smoother and everyone functioned well together again. This made the work function a lot smoother overall.
